# Repository maintenance and release

## How to release new version

* Run `make release VERSION=X.Y.Z`
* Create pull request with the latest commit with bumped versions
* Ask for merge of pull request. Once it is merged:
* Checkout latest master tag it vX.Y.Z
* Push the tag to master branch (`git push --tags`)

## readthedocs integration
Repository is integrated with readthedocs pages. Currently, we have set up three separate documentation projects:
- gooddata-sdk
- gooddata-pandas
- gooddata-fdw

The setup requires special configuration in project advanced settings:
- Field requirements file - set to `<project>/docs/requirements.txt`
- Field Python configuration file - set to `<project>/docs/conf.py`

Project environment variable `CWD_TO_ROOT_RELATIVE` must be set to `.` with public access.

### Webhooks to github
User used to create project integration must have admin rights to the repository and OAuth to organization must be
permitted. If any of it is missing, readthedocs will not be able to set up webhooks in the repository. Once webhooks
are created, user admin rights to repository can and should be revoked.

### Webhooks alternative
Even if webhooks are currently in use, they could be replaced with github action https://github.com/dfm/rtds-action.
Github action together with github-vault integration would make possible to maintain readthedocs setup without help of
other teams.
